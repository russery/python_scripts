# python_scripts
This is a collection of python scripts I've authored for various purposes. YMMV, and these are generally rough and ready, just fleshed out enough to do what I wanted from them. Perhaps they'll be a useful starting point for someone else though.

## slack_imgur_search.py
This searches for all the imgur links in a given #slack channel or 
private conversation.

To use:

1. Replace the API_KEY with your API_KEY, which may be obtained
at `https://api.slack.com/web`
2. Replace CHANN_NAME with the channel or conversation name that you
wish to search
